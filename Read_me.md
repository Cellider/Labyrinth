Hi, I'm Lucas and this is my game project made using Pygame library.

The objective: run around the labyrinth like map and collect as many point as you can while trying to not hit the wall.

The enemies are the walls, that if the player is not careful and hit them, the player will be put at the center of the labyrinth and lose 1 life.
